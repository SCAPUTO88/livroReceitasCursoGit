## Paitan Shoyu Ramen



### **Chicken Paitan**

A simpler approach for making a creamy soup at home, chicken paitan is full-bodied and rich in chicken flavor.  



**Ingredients:**

- 3 kg/6.6 lb chicken backs
- 1 kg/2.2 lb chicken feet
- 6 L water

- 1 onion, split in half
- 10 garlic cloves
- 1 2-in piece of ginger
- Optional: green onions, carrot, etc



 **Steps:**



1. Add the chicken parts and water to a pot.
2. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising.
3. Cook at a medium boil for 6 hours, stirring frequently, and adding water to ensure bones are covered.
4. Add aromatics, boil thoroughly for one hour.
5. Strain the soup.
6. To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won’t be as strong.
7. Reserve the soup as needed.
